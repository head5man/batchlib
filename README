# batchlib

batchlib is an effort to introduce batch script commands as a reusable library.
This is also my first crack at publishing @github.

Initial focus is to provide remote commands run on SERVER and DEVICE to accomplish remote build and deployment.

## Installation

Copy commands-file to your main batch file location.

Copy and rename _user_config.bat.template to %userprofile%\Documents\configs\%APP%_user_config.bat to configure tools, SERVER and DEVICE. 



## Usage

```batch
:: Set environment you can provide your own in %1.
:: Otherwise %userprofile%\Documents\configs\%APP%_user_config.bat is used
call commands set_env
:: Just printing setup
call commands print_env
:: run echo command @DEVICE
call commands exec_cmd_target "echo You should see me. Provided the proper DEVICE configuration"
```
